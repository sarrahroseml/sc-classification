## Objective 

This project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of 4 basic ML models (MLP, KNN, RF and SVM) on classifying RNA-Seq data into 9 different cell-types. They are: Thy1, Gad1, Tbr1, Spink8, Mbp, Aldoc, Aif1, Cldn5, and Acta2. This is a replication of an earlier project with adapted code [https://github.com/bradenkatzman/CellClassificationMachineLearning/blob/master/README.md].
